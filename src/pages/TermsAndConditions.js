          To start working on your website design, we need an upfront payment of
          at least fifty (50) percent of the total cost mentioned in the project
          quotation. After we finish the work, the remaining fifty (50) percent
          is due before we upload the website to the server or release any
          materials.

          Any delays at the client’s end may delay the project and proposed

          Any changes or updates made to a task that has already been completed
          will not result in any additional charges for the lifetime. This
          includes adding or updating content, adding images to existing
          sections, updating offers, contacts, and addresses. You will not be
          charged any extra amount for these modifications.

          Hosting charges are not included in the quotations unless mentioned
          otherwise. Webybuild can organize an appropriate hosting solution if
          required, a quote for which will be submitted separately and approved
          by the client. Where clients decide to organize their own hosting, we
          should be consulted before finalizing the type of hosting and
          database, as it should meet the requirements of the technology used
          for the development. Please note that we’ll require full access with
          hosting support for testing and deploying the application. Webybuild
          will not be liable for any delays or errors caused by direct or
          indirect actions of the hosting company.

          its best in recognizing the suitability of any such component, any
          unforeseen limitations of 3rd party components are beyond our control.
          Any third-party component purchase costs (such as SSL, Payment
          gateway, Google AdWords, Plug-in licenses etc) are not included in our

          The client must recognize that at times there may be unforeseen
          circumstances that will delay the development process, particularly
          with reference to the integration of third-party software. We will try
          our best to complete the project as agreed in the proposal. As long as
          it is within a reasonable period, the client agrees not to penalize us
          for any genuine delay, when every effort to keep the project on the
          proposed schedule is taken.

          A link to Webybuild will appear in either small type or by a small

          it will be designed to fit in with the overall site design. The Client

          Client wants to use any copyrighted information or files from a third
          party, they need to get permission and rights. It is the Client's
          responsibility to grant Webybuild permission and rights to use that

          result from their negligence or failure to obtain proper copyright
          permissions. When the Client signs a contract for website design or
          placement, it guarantees that they have obtained all necessary
          permissions and authorities. Webybuild may ask for evidence of these
          permissions and authorities.
